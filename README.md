This is the first project of the SCRIMBA AI Engineer Path

I decided to code this in plain JS for practice (NOT recommended, as the API Keys will be visible in dev tools).

In order to make this work, you'll need api keys from

- OpenAI
- Polygon (polygon.io)
  insert the keys where indicated.

indexvanilla.html and
scriptvanilla.js
are the simplified version and only show how to include OpenAI Chat Completion - without rendering on the page
